    <h1>Introduction</h1>
  <p class="p-border">Hello my name is Renzo Hall. I am a designer by heart. I love to use my imagination to create buildings, creatures, weapons, vehicles, all sorts of things. I have always been interested in Game Design. It's where my creativity comes from.</p>

  <p class="p-border">Another area of learning that I am wanting to do is Sound Engineering/Game Sound Design. As I always could hear the smallest of details in any movement of a character be it a movie or game. The creation of these sounds is also what intrigues me the most, since I love to make my own things I never try to miss out on designing sound cues or giving the sounds of a person walking into the forest more... umph.
   During my time taking these classes I attended an entirely separate school from my own that's called a technical school. During my time there I achieved quite a few High Honors as well as Honors while at the technical school. If it was not for me discovering the intricacies of games and the stories they told, I would not be where I currently am attending a class that specializes in graphic design and web design.</p>
